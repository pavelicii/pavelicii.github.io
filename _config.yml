about_me_description: > 
  QA Automation Engineer with the commitment to deliver superior software by implementing effective quality control 
  procedures and continuous testing process in the development lifecycle.
  <br><br>
  Throughout the 5 years of experience in API, Web, Mobile, Load, and Desktop testing I've been doing a lot of 
  activities starting from manual regression checks and ending with the implementation of a test automation 
  infrastructure from scratch, combining E2E and load tests, CI/CD and TMS integration, cloud-based test execution, 
  test coverage calculation, and test reports visualization.
  <br><br>
  With Java being my main language, I also had multiple side-tasks which required the use of Python, Groovy, Kotlin, 
  Scala, Bash, and C#. It was always a new enjoyable experience for me hence I'm constantly willing to learn new 
  technologies and practices. 
  <br><br>
  I'm a regular visitor to the professional IT conferences since I intend to be on the same page with the current trends 
  in testing and development. I also try to give back what I can to the QA community. For example, I've developed and 
  opensourced <a class="highlight-link" href="https://github.com/pavelicii/allpairs4j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  AllPairs4J</a>  â€” a Java library for pairwise test data generation. You can find it on my <a class="highlight-link" 
  href="https://github.com/pavelicii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub profile</a>, along with other coding 
  examples.
